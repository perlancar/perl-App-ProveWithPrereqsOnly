# ABSTRACT: prove + lib::prereqs::only (requires only)
# PODNAME:

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<prove>:

 % prove-with-prereqs-only ...


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a shortcut for:

 % PERL5OPT=-Mlib::prereqs::only prove ...

It runs your test suite but will only allow loading of core modules, modules
under C<lib/>, and modules specified as prereqs (runtime & test requires) in
F<dist.ini>. This is a cheap way to simulate a "vanilla" perl installation
without having to prepare e.g. a new perlbrew instance.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG => bool

Will be passed as C<debug> option to lib::prereqs::only.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<lib::prereqs::only>
